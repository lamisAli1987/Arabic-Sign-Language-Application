The experimental setup was implemented on a laptop computer running a 64-bit Windows 10 Pro operating system. The hardware specifications include an HP device with a 2nd Generation Intel® Core™ i5 processor, a processor speed of 2.40 GHz, 8 GB of RAM, and an integrated Intel HD Graphics 520 card with 1 GB of display memory.

The primary language used for model training and experimentation was Python, specifically within the Jupyter Notebook environment. TensorFlow's software environment served as the deep learning framework, and the training and evaluation processes for the MobileNetV2 model were conducted on the Kaggle platform, which provided sufficient computational resources for deep learning tasks.

For mobile application development, Android Studio was utilized in conjunction with the Flutter framework and Dart language to build an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Additionally, Firebase was employed as a backend service to handle database storage, authentication, and real-time data synchronization, enabling seamless integration and enhanced functionality for the mobile application.
