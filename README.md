# Arabic-Sign-Language-Application
The "Asharatii" app, developed for Arabic sign language, is an Android mobile application solution built using the Flutter framework. This app has improved sign language communication by providing an easy-to-use interface for learning and interpreting sign language gestures.
An Android application uses deep learning (MobileNet V2) to recognize sign language in text from live feeds, videos, and images. Also, it interprets the text into sign language and then sends the gesture through Bluetooth to the prototype robotic hand to mimic.
